This is a planner app that allows you to stay organized with a minimalistic environment. We know
that some students and people in particular need an easy-to-use application to keep organized. Perfect
Planner allows the user:
* To store an assignment's due date

* A place to check off when the assignment is complete

Besides being used as a planner, it can also be used as a generalized planner!

Did we mention it is free, too?
